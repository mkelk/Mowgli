# Preqrequisites

ST Link, and OpenOCD

# Firmware restore (ST Link + openocd)

Edit the restore.sh script, and update the filename to whatever your backup is called and run it.

You should see the normal panel behaviour, plenty of LEDS active, panel locked etc ..

# Backing up your firmware

## Locating the connector

There is a 4-pin connector on the board (J9) - it has silkscreen that is labeled with GND, SWCL, SWDA, 3V3 pins.

## Backing up the firmware yourself (ST Link + openocd)

run the backup_firmware.sh script

You should then find a firmware_backup.bin in the current folder

Check the SHA256 hashes at the bottom of the page to confirm a successfull backup, if they are listed already - if not please let me know your model and the fw details in the #reverse-engineering channel so i can update this list.

## Backing up the firmware yourself (JLink Segger + openocd)

Reference: https://medium.com/techmaker/reverse-engineering-stm32-firmware-578d53e79b3

(Assuming linux)

This step is easier with an interactive session because the length of your flash may be different per board

Start the openocd session. For j-link (and clones) 

    sudo openocd -c "adapter driver jlink" -c "adapter speed 2000" -c "transport select swd" -f "target/stm32f1x.cfg" 

Connect to the openocd session in a new terminal window

    telnet 127.0.0.1 4444

In that prompt try running these commands to connect to halt+reset it

    init 
    reset init

List flash banks available on the board - there should be one (size 0x00040000)

    flash banks 

Read the firmware and save it to firmware.bin, use the size you got from the previous step 

    flash read bank 0 firmware.bin 0 0x00040000

Exit the session

    exit

Now you should have a firmware.bin file in the CWD you ran the openocd daemon
